#### ArduPilot

You can run ArduPilot on Raspberry Pi 3 or 2 with Navio2. The autopilot's code works directly on Raspberry Pi. For ArduPilot to work properly please use the configured Raspbian distribution that we provide.  

#### Installing ArduPilot

Log in to your Raspberry Pi using SSH and install the package. It includes all vehicles and is based on the most stable branch available. Currently these are:

* ArduPlane 3.6.0
* ArduRover 3.0.1
* ArduCopter 3.4-rc1

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apm-navio2
```
Navio2 is supported in ArduPilot upstream and if you'd like to build the binary yourself please proceed to the [Building from sources](building-from-sources.md).

#### Running ArduPilot

Supported vehicle types are:

* ArduRover
* ArduPlane
* ArduCopter-quad
* ArduCopter-tri
* ArduCopter-hexa
* ArduCopter-y6
* ArduCopter-octa
* ArduCopter-octa-quad
* ArduCopter-heli
* ArduCopter-single

To run ArduPilot binary type the following in your RPi's console (change ArduCopter-quad to your vehicle type):

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo ArduCopter-quad -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550
```
If you build ArduPilot from sources launch obtained binary file:
```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo ./arducopter -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550
```

Where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address of the device with the Ground Control Station - your laptop, smartphone etc.

Arguments specify serial ports (TCP or UDP can be used instead of serial ports) :

* -A is for primary telemetry
* -B is for external GPS
* -C is for secondary telemetry (it can be used without primary telemetry)
* -E is for secondary external GPS

When using UART for telemetry please note that default baud rates are:
115200 for primary (-A)
57600 for secondary (-C)
3DR Radios are configured for 57600 by default, so te simplest way to connect over them is to run with -C option.
If you would like to transfer telemetry over the UART port on Navio you can specify it like this:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo ArduCopter-quad -C /dev/ttyAMA0
```

UDP and serial telemetry can be used simultaneously like this:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo ArduCopter-quad -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550 -C /dev/ttyAMA0
```

#### Autostarting ArduPilot on boot

To automatically start ArduPilot on boot add the following (change -A and -C options to suit your setup) to /etc/rc.local file on your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo nohup ArduCopter-quad -A udp:192.168.1.2:14550 -C /dev/ttyAMA0 > /home/pi/startup_log &
```

#### Connecting to the GCS

**Mission Planner**

A Windows only ground station. It is the most feature complete, though.

**QGroundControl**

A crossplatform ground station for Mavlink-based flight stacks (like Ardupilot).

**APM Planner**

APM Planner is a ground station software for APM. It can be downloaded from the
[ardupilot.com](http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?category=35)

APM Planner listens on UDP port 14550, so it should catch telemetry from the drone automatically.

**MAVProxy**

MAVProxy is a console-oriented ground station software written in Python that can be used standalone or together with APM Planner. Itâ€™s well suited for advanced users and developers.

To install MAVProxy use [Download and Installation](http://ardupilot.github.io/MAVProxy/html/getting_started/download_and_installation.html) instructions.


To run it specify the --master port, which can be serial, TCP or UDP. It also can perform data passthrough using --out option.

```bash
mavproxy.py --master 192.168.1.2:14550 --console
```

Where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address of the GCS, not RPi.
